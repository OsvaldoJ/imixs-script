Installation and setup the Glassfish Application Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 This sections will explain the configuration steps needed to successfully deploy the
 Imixs JSF Sample Application in conjunction with the Glassfish Java EE Server. 
 
 You can download the Glassfish Server from the {{{http://www.glassfish.org}Glassfish project site}}.
 This side also includes an Installation guide for installing Glassfish on different platforms.
 Glassfish is provided in two versions. Version 2.1 is a Java EE5 Implementation. The newer Version Glassfish 3 is 
 based on the Java EE6 specification. The setup for these version is similar so you can choose both.
 
 After you have installed the Glassfish Server you can start the server by
 switching into the directory
 
+------------------------------------+  
 GLASSFISH_DIST/domains/domain1/bin
+------------------------------------+  
 
 and execute the startsrv script.
 
 After the server is started you can open the Glassfish web console with the following URL:

+------------------------------------+  
  http://localhost:4848/
+------------------------------------+  
  
 The default user name is 'admin' and the default password is 'adminadmin'
 
    
* Setting up a Imixs Workflow database pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The Imixs Sample application uses a database resource with the name "jdbc/workflow-db". So you need first to 
 set up a Database Pool and a JDBC resource before you are able to deploy the application
 successful. In this example we create a database pool for the build-in derby database from GlassFish. 
 You can also configure any other database like MySQL, Oracle, Informix, Microsoft SQL Server,....

 To create a new database pool in GlassFish follow these steps:

   1. make sure the derby database is started   
       
+------------------------------------+  
 GLASSFISH_DIST/bin/asadmin start-database
+------------------------------------+   

   2. start admin console -> http://localhost:4848/asadmin   
   
   3. navigate to   Application Server  >>  Resources  >>  JDBC  >>  Connection Pools
   
   4. click "new" to create a new database source
  
       * name: your database name (e.g. "imixs_db_pool")
  
       * resource type : javax.sql.DataSource
  
       * Database Vendor : Derby
       
   5. click "next". Now only the following property settings are necessary:
   
       * ConnectionAttributes: ;create=true
  
       * DatabaseName: "imixs_db_pool"
  
       * Password: "APP"
  
       * User: "APP"
  
       * ServerName : "loacalhost"
  
       * portnumber: 1527
       
   6. Now create a JDBC Resource - Navigate to "Application Server  >>  Resources  >>  JDBC  >>  JDBC Resources"
 
   7. click "new" to create a new resource
       - jndiName: jdbc/workflow-db
       - PoolName: imixs_db_pool 

*Setup Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 To authenticate users against the Sample application you need also to configure a security realm. 
 
[images/glassfish-002.png] 
 
 Follow the steps below:
 
   1. start admin console -> http://localhost:4848/asadmin   

   2. navigate to  Configuration->Security->realms

   3. add a new file realm named "imixsrealm"

   4. choose the class Name "com.sun.enterprese.security.auth.realm.file.FileRealm"

   5. Set the JAAS Context to "fileRealm"

   6. Set the Key File to a new File name. e.g. "keyfile"

   7. open the newly created realm configuration and click on button "manage users"

   8. Add the following test accounts:



*--------------+-------------------------+------------------------------------+ 
| UserID       |GroupName                |Description                         | 
*--------------*-------------------------*------------------------------------+
|Manfred       |IMIXS-WORKFLOW-Manager   | This user will have maximum access |
*--------------*-------------------------*------------------------------------+
|Eddy          |IMIXS-WORKFLOW-Editor    | User can edit all workitems         |
*--------------*-------------------------*------------------------------------+
|Anna          |IMIXS-WORKFLOW-Author    | User will be allowed to create     |
|              |                         | workitems and edit his own         |
*--------------*-------------------------*------------------------------------+
|Ronny         |IMIXS-WORKFLOW-Reader    | This user will be only allowd to   |
|              |                         | read workitems                     |
*--------------*-------------------------*------------------------------------+
|Norbert       |                         |This user will have no access (just |
|              |                         |to be sure security works well)    |
*--------------*-------------------------*------------------------------------+

  
 It is also possible to configure other security bindings like ldap or database-based. 
 Only the realm name should match to "imixsrealm". 

* Deploy the Sample Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Now you can install the WAR file into your GlassFish server:

   1. Be sure, that your database server is up and running. Start it with
      >asadmin start-database

   2. Be sure, that the domain, which you will deploy the application on, is started and alive

   3. Open the Admin Console in the browser.
      >http://[ name of the server ]:4848

   4. Choose 'Applications'  and click the button "deploy" in the main frame

   5. At Location choose "Packaged file to be uploaded to the server" and browse to the location, where the war file is stored

   6. press the button "ok" located in the upper right corner --> ear will be deployed
